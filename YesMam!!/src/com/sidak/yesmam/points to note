from a method name written in xml , u can go to it's defn by holding CTRL and clicking

tag:ghj, filters the logcat messages by tag

MODE_PRIVATE means our preferences are local to the application

use ctrl + f11 to launch an android project	

ctrl+ i reformats a part of code, while ctrl+ shift + f formats it completely

if a line appears over ur text , it means the method or something else 
has been deprecated

by default getFileDir() gives a dir in the private storage part of the app
this is as per the principle , if u want insecure storage , work harder, 
and by default storage applies to secure path
# use java.io for streams and not android.io
#closing of streams is done in the reverse order of opening it
# json can also be used to save structured data locally for persistence storage

#jsonObject implements java map interface

# json array is also dynamic

#for calculating json array length , u do array.length() and not array.length
 since it is a method
 
#before writing to sd card ,u shld always check whether it is there or not

# the 1st event that occurs while using xml pull parser, is the Start Of Document

# xml pull parser is very high performing

#android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 is a built-in renderer, that knows how 
to display a single list item

# adding a library to the build path will ensure that is exported with it

#sax builder is based on streaming , while dom model has the whole file present at a particular time

# android has built in support for sqlites

# calling getWritableDatabase,implicitly creates a database

#instantiate the helper and database when the datasource is created

# u can move lines of code up and down , by using alt + up/down arrow key

#u can add as many calls to the open mthod if u want to
the connection object in any activity is cached

#always rem to close the database, while exiting out, otherwise there will be a 
database connection leak

# content values are again key -value pairs
#the .db extension is not required while creating the database 
# each time u change the structure of the database, u shld increment database_version by one

-------------------------------------------------------------
insert():
table: the table to insert the row into
nullColumnHack optional; may be null. SQL doesn't allow inserting a completely 
empty row without naming at least one column name. If your provided values is empty,
 no column names are known and an empty row can't be inserted. 
 If not set to null, the nullColumnHack parameter provides the name of nullable column
  name to explicitly insert a NULL into in the case where your values is empty.
values this map contains the initial column values for the row.
The keys should be the column names and the values the column values
Returns:
the row ID of the newly inserted row, or -1 if an error occurred

--------------------------------------------------------------------
#oncreate and onupgrade are automatically called by the sdk
and shld not be called directly

# ONLY EXCEPTION TO THE ABOVE WLD BE WHEN WE CALL ONCREATE FROM ONUPGRADE

by default the id returned by the database of a row, is a long

# for cursor.get....() methods, u need to pass in a col index	

# modify the toString method of the model class, so as to edit wht to receive in array adapter

# describeContents() of parcelable interface , tell what kind of specific 
objects does the class contain

# in parcels , u have to pass the data in and out in the same sequence

# each class , which has implements a parcelable interface, 
shld hv a static field CREATOR

# can only increment a database version and not decrement it

# since the col id is a primary key , it means u can't hv same value of it in the table again
# thus if insert() returns -1 , it means that element is already there

# delete method of the database , returns an int not a long as like insert
# calling the finish method of the activity takes u back to the original activity

also u can change the orientation of the emulator , when open
by pressing ctrl + f11, or f12

android:screenOrientation ="portrait" will fix the screen orientation , 
in manifest

while using a hashmap , do :
HashMap<Integer, String> and not HashMap<int, String>

When Java automatically converts a primitive type like int into
 corresponding wrapper class object e.g. Integer than its called autoboxing
   because primitive is boxed into wrapper class while in opposite case
    is called unboxing, where an Integer object is converted into primitive int

killing all previous activities -

Intent i = new Intent(OldActivity.this, NewActivity.class);
// set the new task and clear flags
i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK)
